Given the nature of your financial data and the goal of predicting future 'close' values, let's outline a transformer model that leverages techniques like positional encoding and attention mechanisms, as embeddings might not be necessary for purely numerical data. We'll also consider whether to use both the daily and hourly datasets.
Outline for Building a Transformer Model
1. Data Preparation

    Daily Dataset: This dataset provides a daily snapshot of the market. It's useful for capturing the overall trend and volatility over time.
    Hourly Dataset: This dataset provides more granular data, capturing the market's behavior on an hourly basis. It can be particularly useful for predicting intraday movements.

Decision: Use both datasets. The daily dataset can provide a broader context, while the hourly dataset can capture more detailed patterns. You can concatenate the hourly data for each day to create a sequence of hourly data points for each day, which can then be used as input to the transformer model.
2. Preprocessing

    Normalization: Scale the features to a range of 0 to 1 or use standardization (mean = 0, standard deviation = 1) to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model.
    Sequence Creation: Create sequences of a fixed length from your data. For example, if you're using the hourly dataset, you might create sequences of 24 hours (or any other length that makes sense for your analysis). Each sequence will represent a day's worth of data.

3. Positional Encoding

    Purpose: Positional encodings are crucial for transformers because they provide the model with information about the position of data points in a sequence. This is essential for understanding the temporal order of the data.
    Application: Add positional encodings to your input sequences to provide the model with information about the temporal order of the data points.

4. Transformer Model

    Model Architecture: Based on the "Attention is All You Need" paper, the model will consist of an encoder (which can be a stack of identical layers) and a decoder (if you're doing sequence-to-sequence prediction).
    Encoder Layers: Each encoder layer will include a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise feed-forward network. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to weigh the importance of different data points in the sequence when making predictions.
    Decoder Layers (if applicable): If you're predicting future values, you might use a decoder layer that also includes multi-head self-attention and encoder-decoder attention mechanisms.

5. Training

    Loss Function: Use a suitable loss function for regression tasks, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), to measure the difference between the predicted and actual 'close' values.
    Optimizer: Use an optimizer like Adam to update the model's parameters based on the gradients computed during backpropagation.

6. Evaluation

    Validation Set: Split your dataset into training and validation sets. Use the validation set to evaluate the model's performance during training.
    Metrics: Use metrics like MSE to assess the model's performance. Lower MSE values indicate better predictions.

7. Prediction

    Predicting Future Values: Once the model is trained, you can use it to predict future 'close' values. This involves feeding the model with the most recent sequences of data and having it output the predicted 'close' values for the next day or hour.

Example Code Snippet for Positional Encoding

Here's a simplified example of how you might implement positional encoding in PyTorch:

import torch
import numpy as np

class PositionalEncoding(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, d_model, dropout=0.1, max_len=5000):
        super(PositionalEncoding, self).__init__()
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(p=dropout)

        pe = torch.zeros(max_len, d_model)
        position = torch.arange(0, max_len, dtype=torch.float).unsqueeze(1)
        div_term = torch.exp(torch.arange(0, d_model, 2).float() * (-np.log(10000.0) / d_model))
        pe[:, 0::2] = torch.sin(position * div_term)
        pe[:, 1::2] = torch.cos(position * div_term)
        pe = pe.unsqueeze(0).transpose(0, 1)
        self.register_buffer('pe', pe)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = x + self.pe[:x.size(0), :]
        return self.dropout(x)

This outline provides a structured approach to building a transformer model for your financial data. Remember, the effectiveness of the model will depend on the specific characteristics of your data and the objectives of your model. It's also important to experiment with different architectures and evaluate their performance on your specific task.

IF we are trying to predic thte next 10 hours of close values, what is the role of the encoder and decoder?
-----Phind-----

When predicting the next 10 hours of 'close' values, the roles of the encoder and decoder in a transformer model are crucial for understanding how the model processes and generates the output. Here's a breakdown of their roles in this context:
Encoder

The encoder's primary role is to process the input data and encode it into a set of representations that capture the essential information needed for prediction. In the context of predicting the next 10 hours of 'close' values, the encoder takes the input sequences (which could be hourly data for the past 24 hours, for example) and transforms them into a higher-dimensional space where the relationships between different data points (e.g., the 'open', 'high', 'low', and 'close' values) are more clearly represented.

    Input: The encoder receives the input sequences, which are sequences of the past hourly data points. Each data point in the sequence could include features like 'open', 'high', 'low', 'close', and 'volume'.
    Processing: The encoder applies self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different data points in the sequence when making predictions. This allows the model to focus on the most relevant information for the prediction task.
    Output: The encoder outputs a set of contextualized representations for each data point in the input sequence. These representations are designed to capture the relationships and dependencies between the data points.

Decoder

The decoder's role is to generate the output sequence (in this case, the next 10 hours of 'close' values) based on the representations produced by the encoder. The decoder uses these representations to make predictions about future data points.

    Input: The decoder receives the contextualized representations from the encoder. It also receives the target sequence for the first few data points (if available) to guide the prediction process.
    Processing: The decoder applies self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different representations when generating each data point in the output sequence. It also uses encoder-decoder attention to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence when generating each output data point.
    Output: The decoder generates the predicted 'close' values for the next 10 hours. Each prediction is made based on the contextualized representations from the encoder and the previously generated data points in the output sequence.

Training the Model

During training, the model learns to map the input sequences to the correct output sequences. The loss function (e.g., Mean Squared Error for regression tasks) measures the difference between the model's predictions and the actual 'close' values for the next 10 hours. The model's parameters are adjusted to minimize this loss, allowing it to improve its predictions over time.
Example Scenario

Imagine you're using the model to predict the 'close' values for the next 10 hours based on the past 24 hours of hourly data. The encoder processes the past data to create contextualized representations that capture the relationships between different data points. The decoder then uses these representations to generate predictions for the next 10 hours, with each prediction being influenced by the representations and the previously generated predictions.

This process allows the model to capture complex patterns and dependencies in the data, making it capable of predicting future 'close' values with a reasonable degree of accuracy.
